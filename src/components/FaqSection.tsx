    question: "What does Vyuh Matrix actually do?",
    answer:
      "We build custom AI systems for real business problems — security monitoring, sales outreach, marketing content, HR screening, and intelligent websites. You tell us where your team loses time or money; we design, build, and run the AI system that fixes it. No off-the-shelf chatbot wrappers — every system is built for your workflows.",
  },
  {
    question: "How long until my system is live?",
    answer:
      "Most integrations go live within 72 hours of kickoff. Larger custom builds take one to two weeks. We deploy in stages, so you see working results in the first week — not a demo at the end of a quarter.",
  },
  {
    question: "How much does it cost?",
    answer:
      "We start every engagement with an AI Time Audit: for a small fixed fee we map your workflows and identify at least 4–5 hours per week of automatable work — or you get your money back. After the audit, builds are scoped at a fixed price. No open-ended retainers, no surprise invoices.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is my business data safe with AI?",
    answer:
      "Yes. Your data stays yours — it is never used to train public models and never shared with third parties. Every system we ship uses encryption in transit and at rest, role-based access, and is designed to pass a security review. If you have compliance requirements (SOC 2, ISO 27001, GDPR), we build to them from day one.",
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need a technical team to run this?",
    answer:
      "No. We handle deployment, monitoring, and maintenance. Your team gets plain-English dashboards and simple controls — if you can use email, you can run the systems we build. Training for your staff is included in every rollout.",
  },
  {
    question: "What if it doesn't work for my business?",
    answer:
      "That's what the audit is for. If we can't find measurable time or cost savings in your operation, we tell you honestly and refund the audit fee. We only propose a build when the numbers justify it — our business depends on your system paying for itself.",
